#Points of Interest
Narrative can take on many shapes and sizes; people who want to elevate their own work will often resort to calling themselves "storytellers" within their profession. But what does storytelling mean? How far can it be stretched? How are stories and narratives generated? 

##Questions To Explore:
  * How is narrative qualified and/or quantified?
  * Is it important to define what narrative means, especially regarding more ambiguous works?
  * What is required for the illusion of continuity / consistency?
  * Does continuity matter? How would it be measured?
  * What aspects of human-based creation and ideation are applicable or relevant?
  * Should narrative generation cater to a human audience? If not, then who?
  * Where do generated narratives exist after they are created? Does authorship matter? Is anything truly original?
  
##Answers We Hope to Find:
  * How a computer will parse human narratives.
  * How different narrative types are categorized.
  * What the objective & subjective results will be.
  * What role generated narratives will play in traditional story telling.
  
##Topics of Interest:
  * Video Editing (Cutting and Sequencing – refer to the history of Montage)
  * Video Generation (From Noise)
  * Dialogue / Narration
  * Sound Generation
  * Artificial Existentialism
  * Generated Thought
  * Abstract Narrative

##Potential Routes / Learning Models:
  * Unsupervised Sentiment (https://blog.openai.com/unsupervised-sentiment-neuron/)
  * Object Recognition
  * [VideoGAN] (https://github.com/cvondrick/videogan)
  * T-SNE for similar video / sound / word structures

##Data:
  * Films (Classical / Auteur / Blockbuster / Foreign / etc.)
  * Screenplays
  * Novels
  * Poems
  * Tweets / Texts / Updates
  * Music
  * Speech
  
##Team Distribution:
The project has potential to be split up, combined, and juxtaposed in several ways:
  * By genre
  * By medium
  * By methodology
No designation has been made yet.
